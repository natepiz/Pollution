    If people continue to pollute the earth than we will no longer have a earth to live on. It could affect the ecosytem which would mean that ceratin animals would begin to die off. Also if we continue polluting the earth it could make the air bad to breathe which would cause people to get sick and the the water would get polluted as well which could effect are drinking water and even some animals. This is why people should stop pollution because if we dont we will no longer have an earth to live on.
